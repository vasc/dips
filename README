Dips
====

Dips is compose of two projects, peersim and dips.
    - peersim is the p2p simulator slightly adapted for distributed use
    - dips is an augmentation of peersim with a distributed simulation engine

To use dips you must build both projects, dips depends on peersim jar, present
at peersim/build/jar/peersim.jar and buildable using the jar target of the ant
script in the peersim subfolder

The dips jar is also buildable using the jar target of the ant script in the
dips subfolder

Compile
=======

dips => Scala 2.9 http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads
dips & peersim => Java 6
(ant is recommended)

Its possible to compile without the need to download the compiler:
    - Change the scala_home var in dips/build.properties to `libs'
    - Run `ant jar'

Run
===

The preferred way to run *dips* is with the dips.jar file.

Current version only allows communication between two instances, the first
instance should be started with the command:

    ./dips.jar path/to/simulation/configuration.sim
    (an example config is available in simulation/dist.sim)

This instance will print the following relevant line:

    PostOffice listening on port: XXXX

Take the port value and run the second instance with:

    ./dips.jar -h HOST_NAME -p XXXX path/to/simulation/configuration.sim

Both instances must be ran with the same configuration file
